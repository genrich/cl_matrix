OpenCL matrix for Octave.
=========================

Multiplication with clAmdBlas.

Example problems:

* Matrix elements sum

    Compare performance with [`sum_compare.m`](blob/master/sum_compare.m)

* Machine learning:

    * 2 layered neural network learning with backpropagation

        Compare performance [`backprop.m`](blob/master/backprop.m) vs [`backprop_cl.m`](blob/master/backprop_cl.m)
        with [`backprop_compare.m`](blob/master/backprop_compare.m)
