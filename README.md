OpenCL matrix for Octave
========================

Multiplication with clAmdBlas

Example problems:

* Matrix elements sum

    Compare performance with [`sum_compare.m`](sum_compare.m)

* Machine learning:

    * 2 layered neural network learning with backpropagation

        Compare performance [`backprop.m`](backprop.m) vs [`backprop_cl.m`](backprop_cl.m)
        with [`backprop_compare.m`](backprop_compare.m)
